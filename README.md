## Description

Window Watching is a web app to allow users to view movies using search, genre filtering, top-rated, and more. Additionally, users can authenticate themselves and add to their watch list and favourite movies. Some other features include viewing actors and crew in a movie, viewing actor's movies, and similar movies to watch. To traverse the app, a voice assistant was added to increase accessibility and speed for certain functionalities.

The application was developed using React.js, JavaScript, Redux, CSS, and Alan.ai for the voice assistant features.

Potential Future features include adding a section for TV shows in a similar manner to the Movies, displaying of more ratings on movie pages, and search for actors functionality.
